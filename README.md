## Tracker Application interfacing with Google Maps

My goal was to use Flask to capture delivery Jobs that consists of Tasks. 
Each Task has an address for collection/delivery. 
I used Google Maps to capture the addresses.

### Then I used Postman to test the REST API using Json Web Token Authorisation.

Some of the test cases included:

* POST SignUp
* POST Login
* Post Track Location
* GET List of Jobs
* GET Job Tasks
* GET Worker Location
* PUT Update Job Status
* PUT Update Task Status
